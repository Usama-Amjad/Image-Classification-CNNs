# Image_Classification_with_CNNs_using_Keras
In this project, We created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras with a TensorFlow backend, and we learn to train CNNs to solve Image Classification problems. In this project, we created and trained a CNN model on a subset of the popular CIFAR-10 dataset.
